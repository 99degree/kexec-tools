To build kexec-tools

1. If ./configure deosn't exist, create it

   # autoconf

   If you obtain kexec-tools from a released tarball, you can ommit this
   step.  If on the other hand you obtain kexec-tools from git or some
   other revision control system, then you will probably need to do this.

2. Run ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local] [options]...

   e.g.
   # ./configure --prefix=/usr/local

   For a full list of options run

   # ./configure --help

3. Run make

   # make

To install kexec-tools

   After following the above instructions to build-kexec tools, run

   # make install
